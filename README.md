# What-I-Learned-Week-13

arrow function => `hello = val => "Hello " + val`
Don't use arrow function for methods

Stack- first in first out ie. stack of plates

Queue- Last in first out, ie. formation of a line

`array.push()`the pass in value can be a function

nested array with objects can be really confusing, a good method is use console.log() and identify values level by level
